#  SMSBackupViewer-iOS
An app to display SMS/MMS backups as conversations

The plan is to support the following formats:
- [SMS Backup and Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore&hl=en)
- [TitaniumBackup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup) XML backups
- and other common backup formats (e.g. iMazing)

Might also add support for other chat logs, such as MSN or IRC (MSN mostly because I have some lying around)
